# BC_ConservationCorridors

This repository generates conservation networks. Two approaches are investigated:   

1. Ominscape - based on McRae et al 2016
<https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/oregon/science/Documents/McRae_et_al_2016_PNW_CNS_Connectivity.pdf>.
2. Circuitscape - based on Pither et al. 2023
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281980 

The analysis uses a resistance layer, includes human footprint/human disturbance layer and topographic features, and a
‘source’ layer that weights land/water cover according to how likely
they will provide habitat. These are generated by the GitHub repo - 
https://github.com/DonMorgan/BC_HumanFootprint.

The analysis uses Omniscape
(<https://docs.circuitscape.org/Omniscape.jl/latest/>), built in
Circuitscape (<https://circuitscape.org>), to generate conservation
networks.

### Usage

A run_all.R script is used to initiate analysis and setup global variables. 

General load    
-   01_load.R   

Omniscape analysis    
-   03_run_Omniscape.R  - calls a series of functions including:    
     - crop_Resistance_function.R    
     - crop_Source_function.R    
-   03_Omni_analysis.R    
-   04_output.R   
    
Circuitscape analysis   
-   03_run_Circuitscape.R - calls a series of functions including:    
     - WallTile_function.R   
     - crop_Resistance_function.R    
     - CircuitScapeFn.R    
 
Experimental    
-   experimental_Tile_prep.R    
-   experimental_Resist_Curr_ouput.R

### Project Status

This project is part of a Provincial conservation assessment being led
by the Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship's Biodiversity and Ecosystems Branch. The analysis and code
is exploratory.
